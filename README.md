# Enterprise Rollout
There are several ways to roll VPN Tracker out to your organization. This guide you through the steps for our recommended option. Please reach out to our team, report an issue or open a pull request if you have any questions.

### Pre-requisites
Before you start rolling out VPN Tracker, this guide assumes that
- You already have a working VPN Tracker connection
- You have a VPN Tracker VIP license as a manager on your team
- You are familiar with Configuration Profiles for Mac or iOS devices

## Onboarding Team Members via Configuration Profiles
VPN Tracker supports a customized onboarding flow that can be set up via a Configuration Profile. 

Using the profile you can
- Display a branded onboarding screen to new users with your organization's logo and a custom message
- Pre-determine which email address new users can sign up with
- Automatically add new users to your VPN Tracker team and assign them a license and optionally add them to a specific group

Two use cases are supported

**A. Personalized Onboarding Profile with an MDM solution**
If your organization's devices are enrolled with an MDM solution, you can push a customized profile onto each user's device. 
This allows you to pre-fill the email address and personal details used to sign up for VPN Tracker, so the new user only needs to set a password.

**B. General Onboarding Profile**
You can also omit personal details from the profile, allowing you to just specify the team a user will join and optionally require their sign-up email address to be from your organization's domain.

## How to create your Boarding Profile

#### Using a Profile Editor
You can use a Configuration Profile editing tool, e.g. Profile Creator or iMazing Profile Editor to create a custom Boarding Profile for your team.

We offer a Profile Manifest file that can be used with compatible Config Profile editors:
